# -Recommendation-badge-experiment

This experiment is centered on consumer analytics and the presentation of food alternatives on ap- plications. Understanding how customers make their decisions is critical in today’s environment, especially with the development of meal delivery apps and the convenience they provide. Accord- ing to Business Insider, the meal delivery sector will be worth $161.7 billion by 2023. As a result, we wanted to investigate how specific app features, such as a suggestion badge, influence the con- sumer’s decision-making process. Additionally, we intend to explore how this differs by gender, budget choices, and age.
